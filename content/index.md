# Python Progression: Moving Beyond the Basics

In this short intermediate-level workshop, we will learn how to write Python
with a focus on reproducibility and re-usability.

We will start in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and later move to
running Python scripts from the command line.


## Who is the course for?

- Somebody who has written Python scripts or notebooks and wants to improve their code style and code re-usability.
- Somebody who needs to read, process, and plot data for their work or studies.
- Persons who already use Python for this but want to learn about libraries
  to simplify common tasks and about how to share their workflow in a reproducible way.

:::{prereq} Preparation
- We assume everybody follows on their computer with network access
- {doc}`installation` (but we will go through this together)
